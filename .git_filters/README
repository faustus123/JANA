These scripts are used to do keyword replacement in source
files. The git system is really set up to discourage this
sort of thing since it goes against their "philosophy".
As a consequence, this won't work without some additional 
action after creating a local clone of the repository.
Specifically, these lines need to be added to the .git/config
file:


[filter "rcs-keywords"]
	smudge = $GIT_DIR/../.git_filters/rcs-keywords.smudge %f
	clean = $GIT_DIR/../.git_filters/rcs-keywords.clean


This can be done with a text editor, or by issuing the following
commands:


git config filter.rcs-keywords.smudge '$GIT_DIR/../.git_filters/rcs-keywords.smudge %f'
git config filter.rcs-keywords.clean '$GIT_DIR/../.git_filters/rcs-keywords.clean'


Note that this whole system is set up to modify the file contents
as they are staged (for commit) and again when checked out of the
repository. The actual files in the repository will never include
the expanded keywords. The whole purpose of the system is to:

1. make it easy for developers to see the meta data of
   the files they are working on.

2. make it easier to identify the provanance of a file 
   when examining an installation
