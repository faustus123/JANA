## Getting Started With JANA

For now, it is best to start with a fresh checkout of master. If you are trying to compile JANA as part of EIC,
we recommend using [ejpm](https://gitlab.com/eic/ejpm) instead as it can reason about transitive dependencies
such XERCES and ROOT. Otherwise, do the following:

~~~ bash
git clone https://github.com/JeffersonLab/JANA2 ~/jana2
~~~

JANA is built using `scons`. If you need to integrate JANA into a codebase with a different build
system, [see the FAQ](FAQ.html). To build, you can simply type `scons` from the project root. If you have a multicore
build machine you can speed up compilation with the `-j` flag. Debugging is easier if you set `OPTIMIZATION=0`.
If you run into trouble, you can inspect the exact compiler arguments by specifying `SHOWBUILD=1`.
The main build script lives in the file `SConstruct`, and most of the functions it calls live in `SBMS/sbms.py`.

~~~ bash
~/jana2$ scons install -j8 OPTIMIZATION=0
~~~

By default, `scons` will build to a different directory for different operating systems, architectures, and
compilers. For instance, if you are compiling on CentOS 7 using gcc, your build directory might
be `~/jana2/Linux_CentOS7-x86_64-gcc4.8.5/`

JANA is easier to use if you set certain environment variables.

~~~ bash
export JANA_HOME = ~/jana2/Linux_CentOS7-x86_64-gcc4.8.5/
export JANA_PLUGIN_PATH = ~/jana2/Linux_CentOS7-x86_64-gcc4.8.5/plugins

export ROOTSYS = /apps/root/6.12.06/ # Only if you need to compile against ROOT
~~~


JANA is typically run like this:

~~~ bash
$JANA_HOME/bin/jana -Pplugins=JTest -Pnthreads=8 ~/data/inputfile.txt
~~~

Note that the JANA executable won't do anything until you provide plugins.
A simple plugin is provided called JTest, which verifies that everything is working and optionally does a quick
performance benchmark. Additional simple plugins are provided in `src/examples`. Instructions on how to write your
own are given in the Tutorial section.

Along with specifying plugins, you need to specify the input files containing the events you wish to process.
Note that JTest ignores these and crunches randomly generated data instead.


The command-line flags are:

| Short | Long | Meaning  |
|:------|:-----|:---------|
| -h    | --help               | Display help message |
| -v    | --version            | Display version information |
| -c    | --configs            | Display configuration parameters |
| -l    | --loadconfigs <file> | Load configuration parameters from file |
| -d    | --dumpconfigs <file> | Dump configuration parameters to file |
| -b    | --benchmark          | Run JANA in benchmark mode |
| -P    |                      | Specify a configuration parameter (see below) |



The most commonly used configuration parameters are below. Your plugins can define their own parameters
and automatically get them from the command line or config file as well.


| Name | Description |
|:-----|:------------|
plugins                   | Comma-separated list of plugin filenames. JANA will look for these on the `$JANA_PLUGIN_PATH`
nthreads                  | Size of thread team (Defaults to the number of cores on your machine)
jana:debug_plugin_loading | Log additional information in case JANA isn't finding your plugins
jtest:nsamples            | Number of randomly-generated events to process when running JTEST
